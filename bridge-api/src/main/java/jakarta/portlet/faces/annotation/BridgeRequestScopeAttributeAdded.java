/**
 * The <code>BridgeRequestScopeAttributeAdded</code> annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to signal
 * that the instance is in the process of being added to the container's request scope and that this attribute will be
 * managed in the bridge request scope. This signal can be used by the instance to flag that its {@link
 * jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy} method should not perform any cleanup and instead rely on the method annotated with
 * {@link BridgePreDestroy} to do so. The method on which this annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following
 * criteria:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters</li>
 *   <li>The return type of the method MUST be void.</li>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.</li>
 *   <li>The method on which it is applied MUST be public.</li>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT be static.</li>
 *   <li>The method MAY be final.</li>
 *   <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception it is ignored.</li>
 * </ul>
