/**
 * <p>The <code>Bridge</code> interface is used by a portlet to execute a JSF application. Its lifecycle follows the
 * pattern used by other web components such as portlets or servlets, namely:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>init</code>: one time (per portlet) initialization. Usually invoked during portlet <code>init</code> but
 *     may also occur lazily. Context is passed to the Bridge at initialization via <code>PortletContext</code>
 *     attributes. See method description for details.</li>
 *   <li><code>doFacesRequest</code>: called for each portlet request that is to be handled by Faces. Must only be
 *     called after the bridge has been initialized.</li>
 *   <li><code>destroy</code>: called to destroy this bridge instance. Usually invoked during portlet <code>
 *     destroy</code> but may also occur earlier if the portlet decides to reclaim resources.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Portlet developers are encouraged to allow deployers an ability to configure the particular Bridge implementation
 * it uses within a given deployment. This ensures a best fit solution for a given application server, portlet
 * container, and/or Faces environment. The specifics for this configuration are undefined. Each portlet can define a
 * preferred mechanism. Subclasses of {@link GenericFacesPortlet} automatically inherit this behavior as it recognizes a
 * defined portlet initialization parameter.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this <code>Bridge</code> interface are required to have a zero-arg constructor.</p>

	 *     single bucket.<br>
	 *     For convenience this interface defines the {@link #MAX_MANAGED_REQUEST_SCOPES} constant.</li>

	 *     acquiring the <code>Faces.Lifecycle</code> via which it executes the request. As a context wide attribute,
	 *     all bridge instances in this portlet application will use this lifecycle.</li>
	 *   <li><code>javax.portlet.faces.[portlet name].preserveActionParams</code>: instructs the bridge to preserve
	 *     action parameters in the action scope and represent them in subsequent renders. Should be used only when
	 *     binding to a Faces implementation that relies on accessing such parameters during its render phase. As this
	 *     is a portlet/bridge instance specific attribute, the <code>PortletContext</code>attribute name is qualified
