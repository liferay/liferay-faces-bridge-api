/**
 * The <code>BridgePreDestroy</code> annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to signal that the
 * instance is in the process of being removed by the bridge from the bridge request scope. This method complements one
 * using {@link javax.annotation.PreDestroy} to allow the object to release resources that it has been holding. It
 * exists because the existing pre-destroy method must be ignored as it is called by the container even though the
 * bridge continues to manage the object in its request scope. The method on which this annotation is applied MUST
 * fulfill all of the following criteria:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters</li>
 *   <li>The return type of the method MUST be void.</li>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.</li>
 *   <li>The method on which it is applied MUST be public.</li>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT be static.</li>
 *   <li>The method MAY be final.</li>
 *   <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception it is ignored.</li>
 * </ul>
